# Predicting Employee Attrition using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify the key factors that lead to employee attrition and to build machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) that can predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the company. The analysis was performed on a fictional HR dataset.

## How to Run the Code
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the `HR_Attrition_Analysis.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.
3.  Make sure the dataset from the `/data` folder is in the same environment.
4.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially.

## Key Findings & Insights

### 1. Key Drivers of Attrition
The feature importance analysis from the Random Forest model clearly shows the primary factors driving employee attrition. 
*   **Top Factor:** The most significant predictor was **Overtime**.
*   **Other Critical Factors:** Other key drivers included Monthly Income, Job Level, and Age.
*   **Insight:** This suggests that work-life balance (overtime) and compensation/career progression (income, job level) are the strongest indicators of an employee's likelihood to leave.

### 2. Model Performance
The dataset was highly imbalanced, which initially led to models with misleadingly high accuracy. After correcting for this imbalance, the models became truly predictive.



### 3. Final Recommendation
Both models were effective after balancing. The XGBoost model is recommended for practical use. While the Random Forest is more interpretable, the XGBoost model's superior ability to Random Forest provides a more actionable list for the HR department to proactively engage with at-risk employees.
